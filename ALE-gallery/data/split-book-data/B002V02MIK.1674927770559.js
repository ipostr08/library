window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The adviser to Senator Hillary Clinton, Bill Gates, and President Bill Clinton proves that small is big by identifying 75 hidden-in-plain-sight trends that are moving America, revealing that the nation is no longer a melting pot but a collection of communities with many individual tastes and lifestyles.</p> <p>In 2000, <i>The Tipping Point</i> entered the lexicon.</p> <p>Now, in <i>Microtrends</i>, one of the most respected and sought-after analysts in the world articulates a new way of understanding how we live.</p> <p>Mark Penn, the man who identified \"Soccer Moms\" as a crucial constituency in President Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign, is known for his ability to detect relatively small patterns of behavior in our culture - microtrends that are wielding great influence on business, politics, and our personal lives. Only one percent of the public, or three million people, is enough to launch a business or social movement.</p> <p>Relying on some of the best data available, Penn identifies more than 70 microtrends in religion, leisure, politics, and family life that are changing the way we live. Among them:</p> <ul> <li>People are retiring but continuing to work</li> <li>Teens are turning to knitting</li> <li>Geeks are becoming the most sociable people around</li> <li>Women are driving technology</li> <li>Dads are older than ever and spending more time with their kids than in the past</li> </ul> <p>You have to look at and interpret data to know what's going on, and that conventional wisdom is almost always wrong and outdated. The nation is no longer a melting pot. We are a collection of communities with many individual tastes and lifestyles. Those who recognize these emerging groups will prosper.</p> <p>Penn shows listeners how to identify the microtrends that can transform a business enterprise, tip an election, spark a movement, or change your life. In today's world, small groups can have the biggest impact.</p>";
