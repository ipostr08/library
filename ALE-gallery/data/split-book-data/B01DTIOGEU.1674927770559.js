window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Preview: </p> <p>Robert B. Cialdini's <i>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</i> examines the compliance methods by which marketers, salespeople, and others, such as cult leaders, pressure people into doing things they would not otherwise do. There are six basic compliance tools: reciprocity, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity. Listeners can learn specific techniques to resist each. </p> <p>Humans rely on standard responses in many situations. For example, when one person gives another a gift, the recipient automatically feels indebted and is inclined to reciprocate. These mental shortcuts are usually helpful both to the individual and to society as a whole. Reciprocity helps facilitate mutual aid, which in turn helps solidify social bonds. These bonds in turn strengthen both the group and the individuals within it.... </p> <p>Please Note: This is key takeaways and analysis of the book and not the original book. </p> <p>Inside this Instaread summary of <i>Influence</i>: </p> <ul> <li>Overview of the book </li> <li>Important People </li> <li>Key Takeaways </li> <li>Analysis of Key Takeaways </li> </ul> <p></p>";
