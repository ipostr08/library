Murder is obsolete. Death is just the beginning.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1938, death is no longer feared but exploited. Since the discovery of the afterlife, the British Empire has extended its reach into Summerland, a metropolis for the recently deceased.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet Britain isn’t the only contender for power in this life and the next. The Soviets have spies in Summerland, and the technology to build their own god.&nbsp;</p> <p>When SIS agent Rachel White gets a lead on one of the Soviet moles, blowing the whistle puts her hard-earned career at risk. The spy has friends in high places, and she will have to go rogue to bring him in.&nbsp;</p> <p>But how do you catch a man who’s already dead?</p>";
