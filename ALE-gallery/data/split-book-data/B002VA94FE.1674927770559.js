window.bookSummaryJSON = "When a tremendous spacecraft takes orbit around Earth's moon and begins sending smaller landers down toward the North Pole, the newly arrived visitors quickly set up a permanent spaceport in Siberia. Their presence attracts many, and a few grow conspicuously rich from secrets they learn from talking to the aliens. One of these men, Rick Schumann, establishes a tavern catering to all the various species of visiting aliens, a place he calls the Draco Tavern. <p> From the mind of best-selling author Larry Niven come 27 tales and vignettes from this interstellar gathering place, in collected form for the first time. Join Rick and his staff as they chronicle the seemingly infinite alien species that spend a few moments pondering life and all its questions within the Draco Tavern.</p>";
