window.bookSummaryJSON = "Seth Godin, one of today's most influential business thinkers, writes best-selling books like <i>Purple Cow</i> and <i>All Marketers Are Liars</i>. And in between those annual books, he delivers a daily stream of ideas on one of the world's most popular blogs. <p>Collected here for the first time are eight years of his very best blog posts, magazine columns, and e-books. <i>Small is the New Big</i> offers ideas and stories that can change how you work, what you buy, and how you see the world.</p> <p>It's an entertaining snapshot of Godin's fiercely original brain. Who else would argue that Fluffernutter was a brilliant business model? That we need a service that <i>charges</i> to send e-mail? That you can learn more about design at Hershey Park than at an Apple store, and more about marketing at summer camp than at b-school?</p> <p>All of these riffs add up to a few essential themes:<br></p> <li> Small is the new big because big has gone from a huge advantage to a liability.<br></li> <li> Authentic stories spread and last, but lies get exposed faster than ever.<br></li> <li> The ability to change fast is the single best asset for any person or organization.<br></li> <li> Aretha was right: Respect is the secret to success.<br></li> <li> It's easier than ever to become remarkable. There's no excuse for sticking with mediocrity.</li>";
