window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p></p><p><b>A leading philosopher takes a mind-bending journey through virtual worlds, illuminating the nature of reality and our place within it.</b></p><p>Virtual reality is genuine reality; that’s the central thesis of <i>Reality+</i>. In a highly original work of “technophilosophy,” David J. Chalmers gives a compelling analysis of our technological future. He argues that virtual worlds are not second-class worlds, and that we can live a meaningful life in virtual reality. We may even be in a virtual world already.</p><p>Along the way, Chalmers conducts a grand tour of big ideas in philosophy and science. He uses virtual reality technology to offer a new perspective on long-established philosophical questions. How do we know that there’s an external world? Is there a god? What is the nature of reality? What’s the relation between mind and body? How can we lead a good life? All of these questions are illuminated or transformed by Chalmers’ mind-bending analysis.</p><p><i>Reality+</i> is a major statement that will shape discussion of philosophy, science, and technology for years to come.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p>";
