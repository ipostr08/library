window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fifty people go to sleep in their own beds and wake up in a compound in the middle of the jungle. Men and women from all walks of life with only one thing in common - none of them know where they are or how they got there. Alex is a paratrooper. Yael is a mathematician. Max is a law professor. They can't leave - a lethal barrier surrounds the facility, but no one knows if it's there to keep them in, or to keep something out. </p> <p>The compound is comfortable and provides for all of their needs. There's a warehouse with DNA coded locks. Only Barbara, the doctor, can open a fully stocked operating room, and only Alex can get into an arms room with enough weapons to outfit an infantry platoon. There is enough food and other supplies to last for decades, but nothing to tell them who did this to them or why. </p> <p>For Alex, it's an intriguing mystery - anything is better than digging foxholes in the desert - but he and the others don't realize that time is running out. On the other side of the barrier lies a horror beyond imagination, and the barrier is about to come down. </p>";
