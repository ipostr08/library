window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>The Eye of God,</i> a Sigma Force novel, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author James Rollins delivers an apocalyptic vision of a future predicted by the distant past. </p> <p>In the wilds of Mongolia, a research satellite has crashed, triggering an explosive search for its valuable cargo: a code-black physics project connected to the study of dark energy...and a shocking image of the eastern seaboard of the United States in utter ruin. </p> <p>At the Vatican, a package arrives containing two strange artifacts: a skull scrawled with ancient Aramaic and a tome bound in human skin. DNA evidence reveals that both came from the same body: the long-dead Mongol king Genghis Khan. </p> <p>Commander Gray Pierce and Sigma Force set out to discover a truth tied to the fall of the Roman Empire, to a mystery going back to the birth of Christianity, and to a weapon hidden for centuries that holds the fate of humanity.</p>";
