It’s clear that the gifts are intended to help, but at what price? </p> <p>Caught in the middle is Sam Steele, a high-level programmer and veteran with a tragic past, up against the arrogant, intransigent Colonel Eric Web, who considers Steele a loose cannon and is most concerned with giving the United States an edge in the upcoming battle. </p> <p>As the team races against the clock to divine their visitors’ complex instructions, they struggle with infighting and, ultimately, the question of what it means to be human.</p>";
