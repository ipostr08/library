window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras took 18 truly exceptional and long-lasting companies and studied each in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day - as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: \"What makes the truly exceptional companies different from the comparison companies and what were the common practices these enduringly great companies followed throughout their history?\" </p> <p>Organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, <i>Built to Last</i> provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the 21st century and beyond. </p> <p>This summary is aimed at those who want to capture the gist of the book but don't have the current time to devour the full book. You get the main summary along with all of the benefits and lessons the actual book has to offer. This is a summary that is not intended to be used without reference to the original book. </p>";
