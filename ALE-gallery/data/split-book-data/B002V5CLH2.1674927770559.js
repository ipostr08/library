window.bookSummaryJSON = "\"Science does not need mysticism and mysticism does not need science; but man needs them both.\" These are the words of Fritjof Capra, a theoretical physicist, systems theorist, writer, and lecturer. In this program, Capra uses non-technical language, with no complex mathematics of formulae, to explore the main concepts and theories of modern physics, the revelations coming from particle accelerators and laboratories - and compares them with the ancient tenets of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. In the process, the listener gains a clear and fascinating picture of how such seemingly disparate areas of thought are ultimately quests for the same kind of understanding.";
