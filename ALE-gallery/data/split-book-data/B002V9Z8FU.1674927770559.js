window.bookSummaryJSON = "Jenkins was a robot. He was built to be the perfect worker, tireless and uncomplaining. But, quite unexpectedly, he also became a close companion to generation after generation of his owners as the human race matured, moved beyond the confines of its once tiny planet, and eventually changed beyond all recognition. And then, because he was a good and dutiful servant, Jenkins went on to serve Earth's inheritors. <p>Here is a masterful tale of an Earth overrun by ants, a series of parallel worlds ruled by dogs, and a Jupiter where the human race finds its Gold Age - if \"human\" it could still be called.</p> <p>BONUS AUDIO: <i>City</i> includes an exclusive introduction by Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author Mike Resnick.</p>";
