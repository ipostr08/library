window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of <i>TIMEâ€™s</i> 10 best nonfiction books of the decade&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Meet the new Stephen Hawking...<i>The Order of Time</i> is a dazzling book.\" (<i>The Sunday Times</i>)</p> <p>From the best-selling author of <b>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</b>, comes a concise, elegant exploration of time.</p> <p>Why do we remember the past and not the future? What does it mean for time to \"flow\"? Do we exist in time or does time exist in us? In lyric, accessible prose, Carlo Rovelli invites us to consider questions about the nature of time that continue to puzzle physicists and philosophers alike.</p> <p>For most listeners, this is unfamiliar terrain. We all experience time, but the more scientists learn about it, the more mysterious it remains. We think of it as uniform and universal, moving steadily from past to future, measured by clocks. Rovelli tears down these assumptions one by one, revealing a strange universe where at the most fundamental level time disappears. He explains how the theory of quantum gravity attempts to understand and give meaning to the resulting extreme landscape of this timeless world. Weaving together ideas from philosophy, science, and literature, he suggests that our perception of the flow of time depends on our perspective, better understood starting from the structure of our brain and emotions than from the physical universe.</p> <p>Already a best seller in Italy, and written with the poetic vitality that made <i>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics </i>so appealing, <i>The Order of Time</i> offers a profoundly intelligent, culturally rich, novel appreciation of the mysteries of time.</p>";
