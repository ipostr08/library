window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The second book in the genre-bending Silvers series - an io9 \"can't miss\" science fiction pick - about six extraordinary people whose fates become intertwined on an Earth far different from our own. </p> <p>After their world collapsed in a sheet of white light, everything and everyone was gone - except for Hannah and Amanda Given. Saved from destruction by three fearsome and powerful beings, the Given sisters found themselves on a strange new Earth where restaurants move through the air like flying saucers and the fabric of time is manipulated by common household appliances. There, they were joined by four other survivors - a sarcastic cartoonist, a shy teenage girl, a brilliant young Australian, and a troubled ex-prodigy. Hunted by enemies they never knew they had, and afflicted with temporal abilities they never wanted, the sisters and their companions began a cross-country journey to find the one man who could save them. </p> <p>Now, only months after being pursued across the country by government forces and the Gothams - a renegade group with similar powers - the Silvers discover that their purpose on this unfamiliar Earth may be to prevent its complete annihilation. With continually shifting alliances and the future in jeopardy, the Silvers realize that their only hope for survival is to locate the other refugees - and determine whether they can be trusted or not. </p>";
