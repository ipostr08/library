window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Cosmological Koans</i> invites the listener into an intellectual adventure of the highest order.&nbsp;</p> <p>Through more than 50 Koans - pleasingly paradoxical vignettes following the ancient Zen tradition - leading physicist Anthony Aguirre takes the listener across the world from West to East, and through ideas spanning the age, breadth, and depth of the Universe.</p> <p>Using these beguiling Koans (Could there be a civilization on a mote of dust? How much of your fate have you made? Who cleans the universe?) and a flair for explaining complex science, Aguirre covers cosmic questions that scientific giants from Aristotle to Galileo to Heisenberg have grappled with, from the meaning of quantum theory and the nature of time to the origin of multiple universes.</p> <p>A playful and enlightening book, <i>Cosmological Koans</i> explores the strange hinterland between the deep structure of the physical world and our personal experience of it, giving listeners what Einstein himself called “the most beautiful and deepest experience” anyone can have: a sense of the mysterious.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
