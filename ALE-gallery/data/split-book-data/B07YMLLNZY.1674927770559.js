window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Awareness awakens you to the truth that you possess everything you need right now to be happy and fulfilled.</p> <p>Happiness is your natural state. You don't need to do anything to acquire it; you only need to drop something. This audiobook shows you what that is. There is not a single person who ever gave time to being aware whoâ€™s quality of life didn't change.</p> <p>You see life differently because you are different. You respond to people and situations differently. You see things you have never seen before. Beautiful things. You're much more energetic, much more alive. When you finally awake, you don't try to make good things happen; they just happen. You understand suddenly that everything that happens to you is good. You understand that all is well, even at times when things seem a mess. You discover that there is a loving force surrounding you at all times that is always within reach, always right here in your midst, making your life meaningful and beautiful and rich.</p>";
