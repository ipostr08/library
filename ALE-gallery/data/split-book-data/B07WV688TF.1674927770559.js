window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>If you were in awe of books like </b><b><i>The Martian</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i></b><b> or movies like </b><b><i>Interstellar</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Apollo 13</i></b><b>, get ready for a story destined to become a sci-fi classic - one with the potential to leap from fiction into reality and become the greatest adventure on which humankind has ever embarked.</b></p> <p><i>September 7 2030. Mission Day 1179</i>. Late at night inside the two-person Dragon spacecraft resting on the frozen surface of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, Derya Terzi put on headphones and became the first Earthling to hear the sloshing of the enormous subsurface ocean beneath his feet. Intoxicated with the promise of discovery, he could have sworn it was whispers between inscrutable creatures of the deep. He was convinced they were days away from settling the most profound and existential mystery known to humanity: <i>are we alone in the universe? </i></p> <p>But that was 10 days ago, before disaster stroke. Now, marooned a billion miles from home, what the surviving crew is about to go through will shatter the limits of friendship, courage, and the human spirit.&nbsp;</p> <p>“In addition to telling a truly immersive story - and one so realistic that the stakes always feel sky high - J.P. Landau continues the tradition of sci-fi meant to spur not just the imagination, but action toward a better future as well. He asks readers not simply to seriously consider the utility of space exploration, but to also remember how dangerous the journey will be - and how essential it is to the human condition.” (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)</p>";
