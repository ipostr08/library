And when you’re here, you’ll never want to leave.</i></b></p> <p><b>“On the surface,&nbsp;</b><b><i>The Warehouse</i></b><b>&nbsp;is a thrilling story of corporate espionage at the highest level, but dig a little deeper and you’ll find a terrifying cautionary tale of the nightmare world we are making for ourselves.” (Blake Crouch, </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author of </b><b><i>Dark Matter</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>Film rights sold to Imagine Entertainment for director Ron Howard! </b></p> <p><b>Named One of the</b> <b>Best</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of the Year</b> <b>by</b> <b><i>Financial Times • Real Simple •</i></b> <b><i>Kirkus</i></b> <b><i>Reviews</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Paxton never thought he’d be working for Cloud, the giant tech company that’s eaten much of the American economy. Much less that he’d be moving into one of the company’s sprawling live-work facilities.</p> <p>But compared to what’s left outside, Cloud’s bland chainstore life of gleaming entertainment halls, open-plan offices, and vast warehouses...well, it doesn’t seem so bad. It’s more than anyone else is offering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Zinnia never thought she’d be infiltrating Cloud. But now she’s undercover, inside the walls, risking it all to ferret out the company’s darkest secrets. And Paxton, with his ordinary little hopes and fears? He just might make the perfect pawn. If she can bear to sacrifice him.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the truth about Cloud unfolds, Zinnia must gamble everything on a desperate scheme - one that risks both their lives, even as it forces Paxton to question everything about the world he’s so carefully assembled here.&nbsp;</p> <p>Together, they’ll learn just how far the company will go...to make the world a better place.&nbsp;</p> <p>Set in the confines of a corporate panopticon that’s at once brilliantly imagined and terrifyingly real, <i>The Warehouse </i>is a near-future thriller about what happens when Big Brother meets Big Business - and who will pay the ultimate price.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Advance praise for </b><b><i>The Warehouse</i></b></p> <p>“A fun, fast-paced read [that] walks a fine line between a near-future thriller and a smart satire...makes you wonder if we’re already too far into a disastrous future, or if there’s still some hope for humanity.” (NPR)</p> <p>“Holy hell,&nbsp;<i>The Warehouse</i>&nbsp;is our future, isn’t it? Imagine that one day we screw up the world and our country&nbsp;<i>so damn bad</i>&nbsp;that we all have to live where we work in what amounts to a modern variant on indentured servitude, and then layer on top of that a bleeding-edge thriller set inside a massively autocratic corporate entity, and you&nbsp;<i>still</i>&nbsp;haven’t seen just how sharp, or scary, this book is.... Taut, tense, and masterful.” (Chuck Wendig)</p> <p>“Wildly imaginative yet terrifyingly real, <i>The Warehouse</i> is both a gripping thriller and an alarming glimpse into what could soon be our future.” (Riley Sager, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>Lock Every Door</i>)</p>";
