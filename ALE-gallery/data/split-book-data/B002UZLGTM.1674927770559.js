window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In Douglas Preston's <i>Blasphemy</i>, the world's biggest supercollider, locked in an Arizona mountain, was built to unlock the secrets of the very moment of creation: the Big Bang itself.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Torus is the most expensive machine ever created by humankind, run by the world's most powerful supercomputer. It is the brainchild of Nobel Laureate William North Hazelius.</p> <p>Will the Torus divulge the mysteries of the creation of the universe? Or will it, as some predict, suck the earth into a mini black hole? Or is the Torus a Satanic attempt, as a powerful televangelist decries, to challenge God Almighty on the very throne of heaven?</p> <p>Twelve scientists under the leadership of a famed Nobel Laureate are sent to the remote mountain to turn it on...and what they discover must be hidden from the world at all costs. Wyman Ford, ex-monk and CIA operative, is tapped to wrest from the team their secret, a secret that will either destroy the world - or save it.</p> <p>The countdown begins....</p>";
