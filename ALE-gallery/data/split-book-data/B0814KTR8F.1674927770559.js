window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Now, new in audio and completely unabridged, the collection that made Borges a household name in the English-speaking world.&nbsp;</p> <p>The groundbreaking trans-genre work of Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) has been insinuating itself into the structure, stance, and very breath of world literature for well over half a century. Multi-layered, self-referential, elusive, and allusive writing is now frequently labelled Borgesian.&nbsp;</p> <p>Umberto Eco's international best seller&nbsp;<i>The Name of the Rose</i> is, on one level, an elaborate improvisation on Borges' fiction \"The Library\", which American readers first encountered in the original 1962 New Directions publication of&nbsp;<i>Labyrinths</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>This new edition of <i>Labyrinths</i>, the classic representative selection of Borges' writing edited by Donald A. Yates and James E. Irby (in translations by themselves and others), includes the text of the original edition (as augmented in 1964) as well as Irby's biographical and critical essay, a poignant tribute by André Maurois, and a chronology of the author's life. Borges enthusiast William Gibson has contributed a new introduction, bringing Borges' influence and importance into the 21st century.</p>";
