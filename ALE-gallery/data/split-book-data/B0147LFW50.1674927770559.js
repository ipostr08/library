window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What is VALIS? This question is at the heart of Philip K. Dick's groundbreaking novel, the first book in his defining trilogy. When a beam of pink light begins giving a schizophrenic man named Horselover Fat (who just might also be known as Philip K. Dick) visions of an alternate Earth where the Roman Empire still reigns, he must decide whether he is crazy or whether a godlike entity is showing him the true nature of the world. </p> <p><i>VALIS</i> is essential listening for any true Philip K. Dick fan, a novel that Roberto Bola√±o called \"more disturbing than any novel by [Carson] McCullers.\" By the end, like Dick himself, you will be left wondering what is real, what is fiction, and just what the price is for divine inspiration. </p>";
