window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the best-selling author of <i>The Bomber Mafia</i>, learn what sets high achievers apart - from Bill Gates to the Beatles - in this seminal work&nbsp;from \"a singular talent\" (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>).</p> <p>In this stunning audiobook, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of \"outliers\" - the best and the brightest, the most famous, and the most successful. He asks the question: What makes high-achievers different?</p> <p>His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: That is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.</p> <p>Brilliant and entertaining, <i>Outliers</i> is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.</p>";
