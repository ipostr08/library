window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The River of Time</i> brings together 12 of David Brin's stories, including \"The Crystal Spheres\", which won the Hugo Award for Best Science Fiction Short Story in 1985. Here are powerful tales of heroism and humanity, playful excursions into realms of fancy, and profound meditations on time, memory, and our place in the universe. Who guides our fate? And can we ever hope to wrest control for ourselves? </p> <p>\"The Crystal Spheres\" offers a fantastic explanation for the Great Silence. Instead of being latecomers, might humanity have come upon the scene too early? \"The Loom of Thessaly\" merges classical mythology with impudent modern spirit in a science-fiction classic that speculates on the nature of reality. \"Thor Meets Captain America\" offers an alternate history exploring a chilling scenario behind the Holocaust. In this parallel world, the Nazis narrowly avoid defeat in World War II when they are championed by the gods of the Norse Pantheon.
